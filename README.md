# FLASHCARDS
>This project uses React JS to build a flashcard-style quiz app, and Redux + Redux Toolkit to manage its complex state.

>Users are able to create their own topics, quizzes for those topics, and flashcards for those quizzes. Users are also able to interact with their quizzes by flipping flashcards over.

>This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To Run

Run `npm start` in the project root and the app will be available on port 3000, OR,
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

You can view the deployed site at [https://augustine-ok-flashcards.netlify.app/](https://augustine-ok-flashcards.netlify.app/).

## State

The app's state is totally normalized, with slices for topics, quizzes, and cards.

## Routes

- `/new-topic` – form to create a new topic
- `/topics` – index of all topics
- `/topics/:topicId` – page for an individual topic
- `/new-quiz` – form to create a new quiz
- `/quizzes` – index of all quizzes
- `/quizzes/:quizId` – page for an individual quiz

## To Test

1. Create topics
2. Create quizzes
3. Visit the page for an individual quiz and flip the cards over
